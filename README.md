# Photos and Clips Organizer

## Overview

This program provides an intuitive graphical interface to organize photos and video files by sorting them into folders based on their modification timestamps (year and month). It includes features to handle filename conflicts, allowing users to skip conflicting files or rename them with incremented names. The app also previews images for quick decision-making during conflicts. **IT MOVES ALL FILES FROM THE FOLDER NOT ONLY PHOTOS AND CLIPS**
